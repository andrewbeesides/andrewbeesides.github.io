Not unlike your typical 21st birthday party, Monday the 21st was a wild, wild day.

It all began at a fish market.

As you mutter with disgust to yourself, "what is that...? Did you eat...no...tell me it ain't so...!", allow me to preemptively put a halt to the rumors you undoubtedly plan to spread about me.

Yes -- I ate live octopus. And it was......delicious!

It was only *slightly* frightening.

양꼬치 (lamb skewer) was the follow-up on the Strange Foods Tour.

We went on a mini shopping spree at 명동 during which I bought myself a [clay mask](http://global.innisfree.co.kr/global/en/eng_bestsellerView7.jsp?parm=8) for the very first time. It is not an ordinary clay mask, mind you. It is a clay mask containing Jeju volcanic scoria, made with hardened lava when the volcanoes erupted in Jeju. It tightens pores, removes sebum, exfoliates dead skin cells, offers deep cleansing, enhances skin tone and provides cooling effects. What more could you ask for?

My 21st birthday party wasn't over quite yet.

When in Korea...  
...eat cheap, delicious foods  
...buy cheap, high quality clothes  
...**and** dye your hair with a color it has never known before.

Right?

...wait, what do you mean "no"? Why didn't you tell me sooner!

Too late...

What kind of 21st birthday party would it be without alcohol?

Only 4 more years until I can rent cars without an extra fee!
