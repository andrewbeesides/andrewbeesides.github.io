Sunday was a day of eating delicious food and making new friends! As it turns out, I'm growing more & more attached to Korea with each passing day.

갈비 and 비빔냉면 took the center stage at lunchtime. A lady whom my dad consulted computer-wise offered to take us out for lunch after finding out that I'm visiting Korea. She brought her 3 children (2 daughters and 1 son) along and it ended up being a surprisingly good time. It certainly didn't hurt that the 갈비 -- *Korean 갈비*, that is -- is the most delicious 갈비 I've ever had.

After church, I tagged along with Judy to her friend's birthday party. Awkward, right?

Before getting to the restaurant for dinner, the girls bought gifts at ArtBox, Kate wrote a birthday card, all the while I made use of my fancy camera.

2차 was at Gong Cha, a tea shop. I'm not a big fan of milk tea but I've gotta say that they have a surprisingly delightful taro milk tea, yo!

Judy, 지혜 and I left Gong Cha for one more visit to ArtBox. I'm telling ya...that shop has some irresistibly cute products! Come to think of it, I want to go again soon...

I forgot to bring Fitty (my Fitbit One) with me so I have no idea how I did in Fitbit-land...! But let's say I walked around like a champ and leave it at that. Hmph.
