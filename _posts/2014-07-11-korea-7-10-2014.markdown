안녕하세요! Hello from Korea! I will be posting updates in daily batches with blurbs and photos galore throughout my 3 weeks in the motherland. Enjoy!

***

On my first full day here, I had a few hours to kill before my dad picked me up to visit my 고모 and 고모부, so I spent the morning walking around 강남 (Gangnam) nearby the hotel.

I soon came to learn that there are convenience marts *everywhere*. There are two 7-Eleven marts within 2 blocks on the street the hotel is located -- the Koreans have Americans beat on the convenience front!

My first purchase in Korea -- ever -- was at Paris Baguette for breakfast. Classy. I admittedly was nervous at the cash register when the 아줌마 spoke strangely about a "points card" but I recovered pretty quickly by replying "아뇨 point card없어요" and signing for the credit card transaction like a native.

Afterward, my dad picked me up to visit my 고모, his eldest sister. We spent most of the time in the living room, sitting and talking. It had been many years since I had last visited but, strangely, the house was exactly as I remembered it. For lunch, we ate at a restaurant nearby. I ordered the 메밀들께국수. Delicious.

After learning more about Korean culture and my dad's family's history, I met up with my good friend, Jason, to explore downtown Seoul. I don't know the names of the places we visited but I do know we saw a palace, a statue of the king who invented the Korean language, a statue of an army hero and a fancy manmade creek.

After walking along the surprisingly long creek for some time, we finally made it to our destination for dinner. The entree? 닭한마리. It's difficult to describe but I'll try: it's a soup with vegetables, 떡 and a whole chicken in it. It's Jason's favorite Korean food and I can see why. I'm definitely going there a few more times before I head back to the states.

Looks delicious, right?

The thing that stands out most to me so far about Korea is how colorful and full of life every street is. It's amazing how much culture can fit into such a tiny peninsula!

I capped off the long day by taking the subway to the hotel by myself for the first time. As I live-tweeted my subway experience, I felt right at home with all of the Koreans glued to their smartphones.

I somehow missed my stop but eventually made it back to the hotel, ending the day with 13,866 steps, 6.18 miles and 12 floors in Fitbit-land. Score!
