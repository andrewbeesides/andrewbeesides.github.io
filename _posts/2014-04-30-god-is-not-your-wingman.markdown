I've once heard it said that God is a wingman. The context? Dating.

To be fair, this friend of mine referred to God not as any ol' wingman but as the *best* wingman. The reference brings to mind countless episodes from the popular TV show *How I Met Your Mother* in which Barney Stinson, friend of the protagonist Ted Mosby, comically portrays his perpetual obsession to be the best wingman *for* Ted (in light of Ted's ever pursuit of true love) and to have the best wingman *in* Ted (in light of his own pursuit of one-night stands).

A "wingman," in this case, can be defined as one whose primary objective in the "wingman-ship" is to provide the support (moral, emotional and so forth) required by the other party in order to realize that party's intended wants and goals.

Granted, Barney's utilization of the wingman model is overtly comical and is not precisely what my friend envisioned in her reference to God as a wingman but the deduction still holds: **if God is our wingman, the outworking of his omniscience and sovereignty holds primarily in view *our* intended wants and goals.** 

To be sure, God *does* have our wants and goals in view but the outworking of his omniscience and sovereignty oftentimes manifests itself in ways unfathomable to us. That God has our good in mind, the Apostle Paul makes abundantly clear in his epistle to the Romans.

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28 ESV)

But what is meant by "good?" Is it characterized by our wants and goals? Or the void of such considerations? We'd do well by first understanding the preceding verses in order to grasp what is meant by "good."

> Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. *For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words*. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because *the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God*. (Romans 8:26-27 ESV, emphasis mine)

Did you get that? We know not what to ask for, so our heavenly Father has graciously ordained that a ministry (arguably, *the* ministry) of the Holy Spirit is to intercede on our behalf even in our asking! I don't know about you but whenever I bring a request to God, I'm quite confident in my perception of its importance, prioritization and goodness. But, without the intercession of the Spirit himself, our requests, no matter how well-intended, are foolishness before God! Comical, isn't it?

Paul continues by teaching us that "the Spirit intercedes for the saints *according to the will of God*" (v. 27, emphasis mine). The ministry of the Spirit is contingent upon the will of God. Therefore, "good" is not fully realized by the adherence of God to our wants and goals but primarily to his own will. And do you get what's so amazing about that? "For those who are called according to his purpose" (v. 28), God's will is *always* for good.

Praise be to the God of all creation that he is not our wingman!
