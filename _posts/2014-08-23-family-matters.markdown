Before partaking in the Korean BBQ festivities at the Baek's yesterday (excuse me for posting out of order!), Sarah, Paul and I hit up our favorite café, our aunt and uncle's, for lunch. The mission was twofold: eat delicious chicken flautas and say goodbye to our aunt and uncle before I leave for Seattle and Paul leaves for Northridge.

J.J. Abrams would be awfully proud of that [solar flare](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4788758/j-j-abrams-apologizes-for-his-overusing-lens-flares) action going on right there.

My aunt and uncle are some of the hardest working people I know. And their hard work shows -- not only is their [café doing well](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gateway-cafe-san-jose), their eldest daughter is starting at U.C. Berkeley next week!

As God's sovereignty would have it...we randomly-ish bumped into her after lunch when we went to Oakridge Mall for back-to-school shopping.

It's a big week for our family -- two little ones going off to college. Emmanuel. God is with us!
