Church and basketball were today's main attractions. We made use of the subway, our legs and the bus to make it to our first destination in Itaewon (which is widely known as "Western Town" for its diversity).

After church, we headed over to Han River (again) to play basketball. The part of the river that we went to today was a busy and happening place!

After playing basketball for a few hours, I took the last game off to walk around and take pictures of the park and vistas.

We capped off the night with 치맥, effectively rendering our exercise useless. Which is a shame because I amassed 22,146 steps, 9.87 miles and 43 floors in Fitbit-land throughout the day. According to Fitbit itself, I'm an overachiever. Go me!
