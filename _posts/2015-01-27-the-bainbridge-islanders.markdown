Is it only me or is the thought of islanders an eery, slightly frightening one? You know...the islanders...people who live on an island...or *the* island...perhaps civilized...perhaps not...perhaps lost...

Fine. Maybe it's just me.

I will, however, concede that the Bainbridge Islanders seem to be particularly kind people. (During the daytime, at least.) Their mainland is where Steph, Laur (her sister) and I visited this past Saturday for action-packed day of food, tourism and more!

We made our way over to the island by means of ferry.

Our first stop was at the [Bainbridge Island Museum of Art](http://www.biartmuseum.org/). I wouldn't consider myself "cultured" *per se* and I'm not ordinarily one to voluntarily visit art museums but this museum is something else! I almost had an emotional reaction to art or something like that.

Admit it -- you're getting teary-eyed, aren't you?

If those photos aren't capable of bringing on the Niagra Falls, surely photos of oversized, savory crepes and expertly, perfectly crafted ice *creamery* are? Yes, surely. You aren't a robot, after all.

*Laur was absolutely captivated by the works of the crepe maker's hands.*

We made a quick pit stop at a bookstore for a nap...

...and made our way back to the ferry terminal.

Like bosses, we took it easy on the ferry ride and relaxed. Just a short trip home!

*Looks like Laur took it a little too easy...*

*We made it!*

After a short visit to the offices of Moz (for free drinks and snacks, of course!), we headed down toward the Internet-forsaken tunnels of Seattle for our way back to Steph's house for dinner, Just Dance and board games.

Day trip: success!
