This post is 2 months overdue -- but better 2 months overdue than 5 months overdue, wouldn't you agree?

On the 27th of August, Steph and I set up camp at Green Lake Park to enjoy ourselves a wholesome, family-friendly picnic. We feasted on fruits, veggies, cheese, bacon, quinoa salad, chocolates and drinks all on top of the Korean picnic blanket that is a *tiny* bit too small (ie. it's either made for 2 tiny Koreans or 1 normal-sized American).

No date with Steph would be complete without dessert. So, naturally, we treated ourselves to ice cream bars.

Afterward, we met up with Michelle for food and drinks and a photo session around Pike Place Market. It was a sweet chance to work on my photography skills. Not that I need practice, though.

See what I mean? I don't need no practice!
