For part 1 (of 2) on Saturday, Jason and I ate 돈까스 for brunch and then hit up the shopping area of 강남. Chill day, chill photos.

서울 is filled with some straaange looking buildings. I'm not quite sure where the architects were going with some of these buildings...maybe Korea was overstocked with strangely shaped furniture that needed to be put to use?

Our original plan was to visit Dr. Fish Café (ie. where you have your feet cleaned by...fish) but the location at 강남 had been closed some time back, sadly. So, we went to the [Kyobo Bookstore](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=268095) instead so I can buy Korean textbooks and gifts for my beloved family and friends back home. Even more sadly, I didn't take any photos inside the bookstore...

To end part 1 of the day, we ate 김밥 at Bapuri. Even 김밥 restaurants in Korea are adorable!

Part 2 of the day consisted of family times and shabu shabu -- and quite a delicious non-Korean dinner it was.

12,939 steps, 5.76 miles and 32 floors...and then the frog croaked and died.
