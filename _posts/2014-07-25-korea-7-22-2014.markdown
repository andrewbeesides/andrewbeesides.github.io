For those of you who are visually impaired, a visit to Korea should always be packaged with a visit to an eyeglasses shop (안경점) for a new frame (or two). 아빠 and I checked out 2 shops and, sadly, I didn't find any frames I liked that day. We did, however, get a tasty meal out of the trip!

Later in the day, Steph's best friend, Christine, and I met up for the first time and I'm glad we did! We somehow found ourselves at random spots (hole-in-the-wall 떡볶이 restaurant, eyeglasses shop, McDonald's and Baskin-Robbins) within a few hours.

After Christine and I said our goodbyes, I met up with friends for a mini WMBC reunion. 1차 was at a restaurant/bar, 1.5차 was on the streets of 이태원 and 2차 was at the trendy Softree ice cream shop.
