Monday was a day of new records -- the day I spoke exclusively in Korean longest, the day I spent with my cousins 수진 and 봉섭 longest...and the list goes on & on! 수진 set aside the whole day to show me around Korea. And on a hot day, where else to start but at Starbucks?

We spent most of the day in 인사동, a cute neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops.

For lunch, we ate 만두 and 라면 at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It was unmistakably delicious.

Afterward, we walked over to 경복궁 which was filled to the brim with foreigners. I didn't know that Korea is such a popular location for tourists!

We also checked out The National Folk Museum of Korea, which happens to be nearby the palace.

Aren't our Chinese Zodiac animal friends so adorable? 용 (dragon) and I got along quite well.

Nearby the museum, there is a life-sized model of a typical Korean street back in the days when my parents were young. It's pretty remarkable.

After a full day of being tourists, 수진 and I met up with our cousin 봉섭 to eat 닭갈비 for dinner and 망고빙수 for dessert. Nothing beats Korean food. Sorry, rest of the world.

18,471 steps taken, 8.23 miles traveled and 22 floors climbed. I'm lovin' it.
