Another day, more photos to share! The only item on our itinerary was to hang out at 한강 (Han River). As usual, we made use of the subway and our legs to get from point A to point B.

The weather was fairly overcast and gloomy but that didn't stop people from crowding the park to pitch tents, relax on mats, walk dogs and eat fried chicken. Fried chicken restaurant workers walk around trying to convince you to buy their fried goods. So, we did. Yum!

In the evening, a few of us played basketball in our flip flops and dress shoes against some Koreans. We managed to come back from a 10-19 deficit to win the game 20-19. Apparently, the best way to rejuvenate our bodies after a tiring workout is to eat 라면 at 7-Eleven. Oh yeah -- did I mention that there are not one, but two 7-Eleven marts at the park?

*How many Koreans can you fit into a 7-Eleven?*

After a long day at the park, we finally started our trek back home. More walking, talking and subway riding!

On the way home, Jason and I stopped by 죠스 떡볶이 for a midnight snack. 떡볶이 is only 2,500원 (~$2.50)! So worth it.

14,896 steps, 6.64 miles and 22 floors in Fitbit-land. I wonder if that's enough exercise in light of how much food I'm eating...
