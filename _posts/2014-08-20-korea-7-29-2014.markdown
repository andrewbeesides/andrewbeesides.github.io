The inevitable, the unavoidable had dutifully arrived: the last day. I certainly was looking forward to escaping from the Korean weather and seeing my girlfriend...but, at the same time, I wanted my blissful vacation to go on for just a *little* bit longer.

In the morning, I said goodbye to 수진 before she left for work and then hit up 명동 one last time to buy clothes for myself and gifts for others. When in Korea, right?

...Right?

After my final shopping spree, I went back to my grandparent's for lunch. 삼계탕 was the name of the game. What a delicious way to say goodbye to some of the people I love most in the world!

After saying our goodbyes, my dad dropped me off at the airport. As I waited for my flight to board and depart, I blogged, drank iced green tea and contemplated life.

Until next time, Korea.
