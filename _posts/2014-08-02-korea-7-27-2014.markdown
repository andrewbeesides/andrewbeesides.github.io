The 27th was a day of goodbyes.

Like all Koreans do, my relatives and I ate 치맥 for dinner, and my friends and I ate 빙수 for dessert, which was followed by 노래방. If you're keeping count, that brings the tally up to 노래방 3 nights in a row. Impressed?

After dinner, my 삼촌, 숙모, cousin and I took an awkward family photo together. I love it!

I regret not taking more photos of and with all of my relatives throughout the trip...but there's always next year!

Then, I met up with my friends at 팟팟팟 in 홍대 for 빙수 for my 2nd (and last...ㅠㅠ) time. It was delightful. And sad. And delicious. All at the same time.

Oh, how I wish such 빙수 were available in the states!

After 노래방 and taking photos with new and old friends, I exchanged goodbyes and took a taxi back to my friend's and went to sleep.
