Today was family day. And I loved it! I spent all day with my dad, 할머니, 할아버지, 삼촌, 숙모, 이모부 and cousins 수진 and 봉섭. Dad and I checked out of the hotel around 11am and drove to my 할머니's house which also happens to be where my 이모, 이모부, 수진 and 수나 live. By the time we arrived, I saw from the street that my 할아버지 and 삼촌 were waiting for me eagerly. I felt loved the whole way through.

We started the day with the icebreaker that knows no language bounds: a meal.

My 할머니's cooking is fantastic. It reminds me so much of my mom's cooking, which totally makes sense! I talked with my mom on the phone after lunch and she affirmed my sneaking suspicions (that she learned how to cook from my 할머니) and told me that my 할머니 makes the best 김치. To which I replied a hearty Amen.

My cousin 수진 and I talked together (in Korean) for most of the day until she had to leave for work. And it was awesome. The last time I visited Korea, I knew very little Korean so we weren't able to talk at all. But this time around, I came prepared with vastly improved Korean speaking abilities and it made a huge difference.

I shared that adorable photo with my family (and girlfriend who deserves the credit for the Burt's Bees gift idea!) and my siblings replied with a photo of their own!

Joseph is a punk if I've ever seen one.

수진 told me about "카톡빵" that comes with emoticon stickers and I knew instantly that I needed it. 수진 went out for an errand and ended up buying 2 for us on the way back!

The back of my iPhone is now officially adorable.

I didn't take as many photos as I would've liked because I was too embarrassed to ask my family if I can take photos of them while indoors. But I really wish I did because we ended up having a late-night scotch, watermelon and fried chicken "party". There's nothing like drinking alcohol and eating fried chicken with your cousin, uncle, aunt, grandma and grandpa. 

Sadly, I sat around for most of the day so I ended up with a paltry 2,573 steps, 1.15 miles and 11 floors in Fitbit-land. No score.
