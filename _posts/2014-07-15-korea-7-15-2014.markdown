Yesterday, my dad and I went to 군산 (Gunsan) in the countryside to visit his side of the family. By the end of the day, I saw 3 고모s, 1 고모부 and 4 cousins. My dad is the youngest of 7 children so I didn't see even half of the family!

We ate 고기 for lunch, making it my first 고기 meal of the trip. Hello, protein!

We all had an entertaining time at lunch because of our waiter. He kept calling my 고무부 "아버지" and offering him more 반찬 than the rest of us and insisted that he eat it all. He switched from 반말 to 존댓말 and back, too. The countryside is definitely different than Seoul!

For the rest of the day, we relaxed indoors to avoid the hot weather. I snuck in photography sessions whenever I could to try to capture the calmness and beauty of the countryside. One thing to note is that the photographs don't show the infestation of dragonflies (왕 잠자리). They are all over the place.

Ironically, my visit to the countryside was the least laborious of days. I walked 2,404 steps, traveled 1.07 miles and climbed 6 floors. Without a doubt, I gained induced-by-the-consumption-of-glorious-고기 weight. So worth it.
