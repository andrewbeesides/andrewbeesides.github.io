Picnic and hiking at 남한산성 and shopping at 명동 is how I spent most of my last full day in Korea with my dad. 맥주 and FaceTime with my family is how the day ended.

*Note: A friend of mine took ridiculous amounts of photos with my camera the evening before which resulted in my battery dying early in the day. Thus, only some of the day's photos were taken with my sweet camera while the rest were taken with my paltry iPhone.*

There's no doubt in my mind that the highlight of my 3 weeks in Korea -- which was filled with delicious foods, cheap & exuberant shopping and amazing times with friends -- was FaceTiming with my family. Though Korea and California are worlds apart, in an instant, my relatives in Korea were able to see my mom and brothers' faces, and vice versa, for the first time in 10+ years. It was beyond a Kodak moment to see my grandma cry tears of joy as she saw her daughter and grandsons, my mom talk
with her younger sister and the rest of us smile and laugh like it was an ordinary Monday night.

이 세상이 정말 좋다.
