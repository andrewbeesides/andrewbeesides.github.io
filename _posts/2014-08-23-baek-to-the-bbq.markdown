Tomorrow, Paul leaves for college.

So, today, our family and Sammy's family went over to the Baek's for Korean BBQ. I know not of a sweeter way to exchange the most bittersweet of goodbyes.

Joey was our resident king shrimp chef for the evening. I'm not ordinarily big on bottom dwellers but I've gotta hand it to the chef for serving up well-cooked, succulent shrimps. Yum.

I'd be remiss if I didn't upload a photo of the grill master himself, Mr. Baek, without whom the dinner would've been but a dream.

Paul wears *many* hats at True Light Church. He regularly babysits the children, teaches Sunday school and lovingly looks out for the youth kids. Sammy is one of those youth kids. He's a good kid with a good heart raised by fantastic parents.

What do you get when you mix delicious food, family and friends together? It's hard to say conclusively but I do know that goofy times and stuffed faces are definitely included!

The moms requested that I take photos of them chilling by their shrimp grill "bonfire"...twice. Too funny.

After cleaning up outside, we went indoors to eat snacks, play Kinect Sports Rivals and relax. Turns out the Baek boys bought an Xbox One with the allowance money they received when visiting Korea this summer! Savvy kids.

Before the evening ended, Joel brought out a farewell gift that the Baeks had prepared together for Paul. Joey, Joel and the parents had all written cards in appreciation of how selflessly Paul pours his life into the families of True Light Church. I hear that!

As we walked out the driveway and explained to Joel that Paul will come back to visit during Thanksgiving weekend -- 3 months later -- Joel exclaimed aloud what the rest of us were thinking silently: "that's a long time!"
