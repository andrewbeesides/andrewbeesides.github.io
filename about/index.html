          I’m a Bay Area native turned Seattleite. My ancestors call Jeju Island their home.
          I studied computer science in beautiful La Jolla, California. I’m a
          <a href="http://moz.com/about/team/andrewyang">Mozzer</a> and quite proud of it.
          I’m a sinner and look to Jesus as my only hope. I dabble in photography
          (with my Oly OM-D E-M5). I once called songwriting and recording a hobby.
          I love my family very much. I love my girlfriend too. I used to skateboard.
          I still snowboard. I love rainy days. I love the snow. I learned how to smile in
          photographs in the past few years.
