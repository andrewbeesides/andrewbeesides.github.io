					Some years ago, our dear mother told us, "because of my children, I feel
					rich" -- even though we grew up without much. At the time, I didn't have
					a category for contentment. Don't get me wrong -- I treasured my family
          dearly but, I didn't fully understand that the source of my net worth
          isn't measured by my bank statements or belongings but by my family and
					friends and the memories we cherish together.

					In many ways, I'm still learning that lesson. I oft get tangled up in my
					pursuit of amassing tech gadgets upon tech gadgets. But, I'd like to think
					that slowly, slowly, slowly, I am learning to find my self-worth in the
					people who love me most.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					This blog is an ode to those very people I love so much. More often than
					not, my posts will be filled with photos capturing my time spent with
					them. Other times, I'll write about something deeply profound and
					theological (or so I'd like to think). Would you join me on this journey?
